Figure 3 shows the effect on a 10-Mbps, 40-ms flow of BtlBw abruptly doubling to 20 Mbps after 20 seconds of steady operation (left graph) then dropping to 10 Mbps after another 20 seconds of steady operation at 20 Mbps (right graph).

- 10 mbps to 20 mbps after 20 secons, another 20 seconds
- latency is 40-ms
