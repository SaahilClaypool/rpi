# Summary: 

Basically, more things effect the window than expected. And, before, we had settings that made pi act odd. Now, they don't quite act the same, but both have reasonable behavior. Is that a reasonable summary?

## Misc:

pi and pc windows diverge

window scaling is good, but makes window size unpredictable

Nothing really matters with  no loss?
